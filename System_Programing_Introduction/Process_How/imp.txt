When a process is created, there are three file pointers are opened by default. They are defined in stdio.h header.
These concepts are part of UNIX system programming and help you understand how stdin, stdout, and stderr work, and how redirection is done internally.
File Descriptors (0, 1, 2)

When any process starts, three file descriptors are automatically opened:
| Name     | Integer FD | Meaning         | Connected To          |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `stdin`  | **0**      | Standard Input  | Keyboard (by default) |
| `stdout` | **1**      | Standard Output | Console screen        |
| `stderr` | **2**      | Standard Error  | Console screen        |



stdout_save = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);
✔ What dup() does:

dup(old_fd) creates a copy of the file descriptor.
stdout_save = dup(1);
