When a process is created, there are three file pointers are opened by default. They are defined in stdio.h header.
These concepts are part of UNIX system programming and help you understand how stdin, stdout, and stderr work, and how redirection is done internally.
File Descriptors (0, 1, 2)

When any process starts, three file descriptors are automatically opened:
| Name     | Integer FD | Meaning         | Connected To          |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `stdin`  | **0**      | Standard Input  | Keyboard (by default) |
| `stdout` | **1**      | Standard Output | Console screen        |
| `stderr` | **2**      | Standard Error  | Console screen        |



stdout_save = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);
✔ What dup() does:

dup(old_fd) creates a copy of the file descriptor.
stdout_save = dup(1);

fflush(stdout);
✔ Why?

printf uses buffered output.

fflush(stdout) ensures all buffered text is written to the file before you switch stdout back to console.

Otherwise, some text may not appear in the file.

Restoring stdout
dup2(stdout_save, STDOUT_FILENO);
close(stdout_save);


Now:

stdout is restored to the original console

You clean up the backup
