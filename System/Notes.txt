SECTION 3 — UNIX SYSTEM PROGRAMMING (IN C)

We will go step-by-step in this order:

1️⃣ Process Creation (fork, exec, wait)
2️⃣ Signals (signal, sigaction, kill, alarm)
3️⃣ Inter-Process Communication (Shared Memory, Message Queues, Semaphores)
4️⃣ Sockets (TCP/UDP, client–server)
5️⃣ Multi-threading (pthreads)
6️⃣ Pipes (unnamed + named/FIFO)


“UNIX commands are programs written in C that interact with the UNIX environment using system calls.”
This means:

Almost every command you run in the terminal (ls, cd, cat, rm, etc.)
Is actually a C program
And that C program interacts with the UNIX kernel using system calls.


What is a System Call?

A system call is how a user program (written in C) talks to the Unix kernel.

C Program (User)  --->  System Call  --->  Kernel (OS)
