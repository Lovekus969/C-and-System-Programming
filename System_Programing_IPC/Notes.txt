Inter-Process Communication

Socket
    Most powerful and flexible network IPC

Works between:
  
    Same machine
    Different machines
    Supports TCP (stream socket) and UDP (datagram socket)
    Used in all network applications

Example:

    Web servers
    Chat apps
    Client-server programs

Pipes are the oldest form of UNIX System IPC and are provided by all UNIX systems.
                    $ who |   wc -1              
Pipes have two inherent limitations.
Historically, pipes have been half duplex (i.e., data flows in only one direction). Some systems now provide full-duplex pipes, but to ensure maximum portability full-duplex pipe is not assumed.
Pipes can be used only between processes that have a common ancestor.
Despite these limitations, half-duplex pipes are still the most commonly used form of IPC. 
Every time a sequence of commands in a pipeline is typed for the shell to execute, the shell creates a separate process for each command and links stdout of one process to stdin of next. 
A pipe is created by calling the pipe() system call.
int pipe(int fd[2])
Two file descriptors are returned through fd argument:
fd[0] is open for reading and fd[1] is open for writing.
The output of fd[1] is the input for fd[0].
