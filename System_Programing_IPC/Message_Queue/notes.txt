What is a Message Queue?

A Message Queue is an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism that allows processes to send and receive messages through the kernel.

Very Short Summary (for fast revision)
      
      Message Queue = kernel mailbox for processes
      msgget() = create/get queue
      msgsnd() = send message (with type)
      msgrcv() = receive message (by type)
      msgctl() = stats/remove queue
      Messages are independent units, NOT streams
      Supports async and multi-process communication
