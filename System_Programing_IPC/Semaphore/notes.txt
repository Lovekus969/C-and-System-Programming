Semaphore
What is a Semaphore?

A semaphore is a kernel-managed counter used to control access to a shared resource among multiple processes.

Think of it like:

   A key that controls entry
   Only processes with permission (value > 0) can enter
   When value = 0, all other processes must wait

Important semctl Commands (Explained Simply)
1. IPC_STAT

📌 Copy semaphore status into user structure

Used to read information about the semaphore set
2. IPC_SET

📌 Modify the permissions or parameters of the semaphore set
3. IPC_RMID

📌 Remove semaphore set from kernel
4. GETVAL

📌 Get the current value of a semaphore (like reading its counter)
6. GETPID

📌 Get PID of process that last performed semop on this semaphore

Useful for debugging.

7. GETNCNT

📌 Number of processes waiting because semaphore value is negative (P operation blocked)

8. GETZCNT

📌 Number of processes waiting for semaphore value to become zero

Used in synchronization tasks.

9. GETALL

📌 Get values of all semaphores in the set

Used if nsems > 1.

10. SETALL

📌 Set values of all semaphores in the set at once.
