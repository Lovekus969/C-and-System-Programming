C was developed specifically for this purpose in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs to write the UNIX operating system. Its design provides a crucial balance of high-level structure and low-level control, which makes it effective for system-level tasks. 

In this repository, we will explore all these topics one by one. The focus will be on understanding what each concept is, how it works, and why it is important in system programming. The goal is to build strong fundamentals by learning the purpose and real-world use of each component.
